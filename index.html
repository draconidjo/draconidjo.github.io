      <h1>Welcome to the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dragon%27s_Den">Dragon's Den</a>! 🐉 </h1>
      <p>こんにちは! I am <a href="http://3dspaint.com/member/?id=137730">Draconid_Jo</a> from <a href="http://3dspaint.com">3DSPaint</a> and <a href="http://socialcu.be/users/profile?user=DraconidJoashu">DraconidJoashu</a> from <a href="http://socialcu.be">SocialCu.be</a>, and this is my very own website! <img src="http://3dspaint.com/chatroom/smilies/alien1.gif" alt="3DSPaint smilie face">
      </p>
      <p>I am undoubtedly going to be adding all sorts of cool stuff here, and also using this site and <a href="https://draconid-joashu.neocities.org">my new Neocities one</a> to help me to master HTML and CSS as well. I'd like to thank <span style="color:pink">
          <b>my besty 4 resty</b>
        </span> for helping me with this, and also my respected comrade <a href="http://3dspaint.com/member?id=150961">DCTheGamr</a> from 3DSPaint for helping me with this as well, and I plan on working on many more projects with both of them, including a number things for DC's <a href="http://venith.net">Greater Venith</a>. </p>
