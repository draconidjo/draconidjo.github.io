<br>
<br>The following is a reposting of the <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101897" rel="nofollow">now-deleted</a> (but <a href="http://digitalcheese.xyz/uwu/thi500-blog.html" rel="nofollow">archived offsite</a>) <a href="https://3dspaint.com/terms.php#:~:text=defamatory,%20are%20not%20tolerated" rel="nofollow">defamatory</a> blog entitled “<span style="font-weight:bold">I can't take this anymore</span>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, written by former Paint admin* <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=80730" rel="nofollow">Thi500</a> (AKA “Aaron” or “AaronAstro”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>) and submitted here on Paint on <span style="font-weight:bold">April 4th 2024 at 14:41,</span> as can be seen in the screenshot above.
<br>
<br><small>*He wasn't actually a member of the admin team at the time that he wrote this, but was reinstated as an admin on <span style="font-weight:bold">February 8th 2025</span> only to be demodded on <span style="font-weight:bold">May 29th 2025</span>—over a year after the posting of this blog—by none other than <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=1" rel="nofollow">HullBreach</a> himself, <span style="font-weight:bold">specifically for having written this defamatory blog about me.</span></small>
<br>
<br><blockquote>Did Thi post a blog and feature it that accused Draco of being a pedophile to harass him? How’s featuring content to harass someone OK?</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—HullBreach</p>
<br>
<br><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/366f5988-9a11-4aac-88ae-72805c51fdac.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/366f5988-9a11-4aac-88ae-72805c51fdac.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br>
<br>The purpose of reposting Thi500's blog here is <span style="font-weight:bold">to add my own commentary to it, in order to provide context to all of the “screenshot evidence” that he presented in it to back up his (and <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=46112" rel="nofollow">Nikki's</a>) “legitimate pedophilia allegations” against me (see the screenshot above).</span> Given that the worst part of his blog (by far) is <span style="text-decoration:underline">his commentary</span>—rather than the actual “evidence” presented in it—I feel that it is more than appropriate to do this, <span style="font-weight:bold">in order to defend both myself and all of the others that he defamed in this blog with his <a href="https://dictionary.law.com/default.aspx?selected=1153" rel="nofollow">libelous</a> statements.</span>
<br>
<br>Some people will inevitably wonder why I haven't simply let this all go, and why I still continue to complain about this blog over a year later. <span style="font-weight:bold">Those people have never been falsely accused of being a pedophile <span style="text-decoration:underline">and actually been punished for it unjustly</span>.</span>
<br>(Not to mention that <span style="font-weight:bold">the people behind this lie <a href="https://snipboard.io/Hju204.jpg" rel="nofollow">literally wanted me dead</a>—<a href="https://snipboard.io/Rf54eh.jpg" rel="nofollow">and still do</a>.</span>)

<br><small>Thi500 refusing to publicly apologize for publicly defaming me (1st image above), and offering me a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mental-health-revolution/202203/i-m-sorry-you-feel-way-and-other-gaslighting-tactics" rel="nofollow">non-apology</a> instead (2nd image above).</small>
<br>
<br>I would have let this whole thing go a LONG time ago if I had received a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mental-health-revolution/202203/i-m-sorry-you-feel-way-and-other-gaslighting-tactics" rel="nofollow">proper apology</a> from Thi500 and a full <a href="https://www.minclaw.com/retraction-letter-defamation" rel="nofollow">retraction</a> of his <a href="https://lawslearned.com/defamation-by-implication" rel="nofollow">defamatory BS</a>, but unfortunately, <span style="font-weight:bold">he has <span style="text-decoration:underline">consistently</span> refused to do so.</span>
<br>
<br><blockquote>“<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Bullshit" rel="nofollow">Bullshit</a> is a greater enemy of the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Truth" rel="nofollow">truth</a> than <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lie" rel="nofollow">lies</a> are.<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>”</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">

<br>
<br>As for what a “proper apology” would actually look like here, <span style="font-weight:bold">it'd look something like the one that <span style="text-decoration:underline">my good friend</span> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=77950" rel="nofollow">Asparagus</a> said to me in the DM pictured below: </span>
<br>
<br><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/320046bc-d494-42e2-b878-0046f225ada2.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/320046bc-d494-42e2-b878-0046f225ada2.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br>
<br>Anyway, my added commentary  in this blog will be colored cyan—just like this part is—so that it can clearly be distinguished from the original text of the blog, and I will also separate the commentary sections from the actual text of the original blog by using the line BBcode as well. It is also worth mentioning that I have reuploaded the images that Thi500 had uploaded and used in the original blog to be used in this copy, since the original uploads of the images were purged from Paint due to him disabling his account here back in August.</span><hr>Hello everyone. My name is Aaron. Not Thi, not Thi500. He’s long gone. My name is Aaron. Since the admin team is so fucking incompetent that they haven’t done anything at all about this situation, I feel complicit by staying silent so here I am talking about it.
<br>
<br>This place has been out of control and harboring the absolute worst in people and actions. After the next few situations it was the last straw so here I am revealing everything before the admin team has a chance to cover it up.
<br>
<br>I was given explicit permission to share certain things and images; however certain people in question don’t deserve to be asked permission. You are the scum of the fucking Earth. These are fucking children.<hr><span style="color:cyan"><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/c7e55536-9952-43bc-a951-5f16472f0255.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/c7e55536-9952-43bc-a951-5f16472f0255.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br><small>Like my friend <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=145053" rel="nofollow">royal-rawr</a> here, I don't think that Thi500 deserves to be called “Aaron”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, because of our friend <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=165958" rel="nofollow">anelikk_aaron</a> here on Paint having that name.</small>
<br>
<br>By “explicit permission” he means that then-active Paint admin <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=46112" rel="nofollow">yaynikki</a> (AKA “Nikki”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>) had given him “explicit permission” to do so, <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> that the admin team did so, hence all of the insults directed at the admin team in this blog. The “certain people in question” who allegedly “don’t deserve to be asked permission” would of course be <span style="font-weight:bold">me,</span> and he felt the need to say this all not only because of the fact that he leaked private admin conversations (which were obviously leaked to him by Nikki) to the public, but also because of <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=99030" rel="nofollow">this blog rule</a>, <span style="font-weight:bold">which Nikki blatantly violated when she had featured this blog.</span>
<br>
<br>Also, take note of the abusive and <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dehumanize" rel="nofollow">dehumanizing</a> language directed at me here. <span style="font-weight:bold">There was absolutely no need whatsoever to call me “the scum of the fucking Earth” here,</span> and he gets away with this blatant  <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog/guidelines.php#:~:text=bullying" rel="nofollow">bullying</a> here by invoking the classic <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/republicans-false-pedophilia-claims-attack-democrats-lgbtq-people/story?id=84344687" rel="nofollow">far right trope</a>—and it is <a href="https://pineandroses.org/culture/fascist-origins-of-the-groomer-panic" rel="nofollow">VERY much a far right trope</a>—of “<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren" rel="nofollow">Think of the Children!</a>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, all done here before any of his actual “screenshot evidence” is ever even presented in the blog, in an obvious attempt to “<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well" rel="nofollow">poison the well</a>” and bias the reader against me before he does so.</span><hr>First thing I will be addressing is user Draconid_Jo. I have my personal gripes with him, that’s no secret, but he continues to get worse and worse as time goes on.
<br>
<br>I don’t care what your home situation is. I don’t care what your dad or whoever does to your internet. Maybe keeping you off the internet is a good thing considering your behavior. You are almost 30 years old, a grown ass man and your only friends are fucking teenagers. Maybe take advantage of your limited internet time and get some real friends your own age, kay?<hr><span style="color:cyan">Firstly, belittling the “home situation” of a victim of domestic violence—<span style="font-weight:bold">which he was well aware that I am BTW,</span> since I had talked with him and <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=32808" rel="nofollow">Angela</a> about that at length in one of the chatrooms here <a href="https://snipboard.io/QzlomG.jpg" rel="nofollow">back in February of 2020</a>—is absolutely vile, and like the countless other instances of cruel and abusive language used throughout his blog, <span style="font-weight:bold">it was also completely unnecessary.</span>
<br>
<br>Also, somehow unbeknownst to Thi500 at the time that he wrote this, my BFF and fellow Paint admin <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=116525" rel="nofollow">UwUQueen</a> is not only an adult, but <span style="font-weight:bold">she is actually older than he is.</span> He later claimed (during <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/30NNW1355G#xgjb3iw5OAr5" rel="nofollow"> “Nostalgia Night”</a>) that “<a href="https://snipboard.io/U84tm3.jpg" rel="nofollow">she might be [underage] idk her age</a>” when he was asked about it, despite the fact that <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/1b3ca57a-2766-4ef4-a140-90c67db588fc.jpg" rel="nofollow">UwUQueen first joined Paint over 11 years ago</a>, which would make that all but an impossibility. I also obviously have countless other friends both here on Paint—including <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=170553" rel="nofollow">Aeries</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=77950" rel="nofollow">Asparagus</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=171148" rel="nofollow">GalacticGam3r37</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=140519" rel="nofollow">GuiedGui</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=152737" rel="nofollow">MattTheTekie</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=139233" rel="nofollow">MrPwong</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=64489" rel="nofollow">rdfcguy</a>, and <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=112766" rel="nofollow">SCREECHiNG FLARE</a>, just to name a few—and on other platforms like <a href="https://socialcu.be/@DraconidJoashu" rel="nofollow">SocialCu.be</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/KKMCrx6bkJ" rel="nofollow">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://xcancel.com/DraconidJoashu" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> that are adults as well, so <span style="font-weight:bold">Thi500 implying here that I don't by saying that I should “get some real friends [my] own age” is (yet another) lie from him.</span></span><hr>Or at the very least don’t fucking mention how turned on you are IN A GROUP WHERE YOU ARE THE ONLY ADULT IN THE PICTURE.

I then follow up (in the same shout in parentheses) by saying “[Then] again, I'm picturing Zinnia dressed like that, not you”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">which was obviously said to clarify that I'm <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> remotely interested in imagining DCTheGamr wearing a maid outfit,</span> as well as to add to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deprecating_humor" rel="nofollow">self-deprecating humor</a> of my joke by making fun of <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=97999" rel="nofollow">my obvious</a> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=100331" rel="nofollow">obsession with</a> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103684" rel="nofollow">Zinnia from Pokémon</a>, <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Bullshit" rel="nofollow">although both of these points were somehow lost on Thi500 and Nikki, apparently.</a>
<br>
<br><blockquote>I don't fucking like dctheGamr but not even he deserves to be talked to that way by a grownup who should fucking know better</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/iXHseG.jpg" rel="nofollow">Nikki</a></p>
<br>
<br><blockquote>yaynikki doesnt realize that this makes her look bad, that literally no one on the entire site pays any mind to her as "sane"</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/7Ps0Dc.jpg" rel="nofollow">DCTheGamr</a></p>
<br>
<br>As you can see, <span style="font-weight:bold">DCTheGamr has a slightly different perspective on these “legitimate pedophilia allegations” than those who are halfheartedly <a href="https://snipboard.io/bv65XB.jpg" rel="nofollow">pretending to give a shit</a> about him here.</span>
<br>(Of course, in order for my shout to be a <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/b99747f2-881b-425a-8aa4-89731b9fcf35.jpg" rel="nofollow">“CRIME”</a> like they claim it is, they need a “<a href="https://constitutionalstudies.ning.com/forum/topics/if-there-is-no-victimtherei-is-no-crime" rel="nofollow">victim</a>” to point to, <span style="font-weight:bold">and apparently even a <a href="https://snipboard.io/8h6EHI.jpg" rel="nofollow">“LITERAL NAZI”</a> will suffice.</span>)
<br>
<br>Anyway, the below screenshots provide some additional context for these 2 shouts.

<br>
<br>It all started off with DCTheGamr talking about his encrypted E-mails, then <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=140519" rel="nofollow">GuiedGui</a>—<span style="font-weight:bold">who was (and still is) both an active Paint admin and an adult at the time</span>—made a joke about how E-mails taste best salted, which prompted me to say that I prefer sweet E-mails over salty ones, myself. Then (as you can see in the bottom screenshot) <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=163471" rel="nofollow">R1N1K4</a> had asked about the whole E-mail flavors thing, and I made a joke about "spicy E-mails", but when <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=157163" rel="nofollow">EvanTheOutcast</a> chimed in I had replied and had implied that spicy E-mails weren't a good thing and that they just burn your mouth. Then (in between that screenshot and the next one) DCTheGamr bragged about his "spicy E-mails" with his GF <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=166308" rel="nofollow">TheAllyWay</a>, which is why I made my somewhat mocking remark in the next screenshot. DCTheGamr replies by stating that “maid dresses are quite hot actually” “Especially when paired with the thigh high socks”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, which is then followed by my (now infamous) shout about being “<a href="https://crossidiomas.com/turn-https://crossidiomas.com/turn-on/on" rel="nofollow">turned on</a>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>. The next day, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=146497" rel="nofollow">JinxCade</a> sees the “sussy messages” in the group and shouts about it, lol! <img src="https://3dspaint.com/chatroom/smilies/alien1.gif">
<br>
<br><blockquote>Some images seem to have been edited versions of screenshots I took and uploaded btw
<br>
<br>[They] were taken bc I thought of it as jokes</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/DPSYx1.jpg" rel="nofollow">JinxCade</a></p>
<br>
<br>JinxCade is also the one who provided me with the <a href="https://snipboard.io/2cpO67.jpg" rel="nofollow">unedited screenshots</a> here that Thi500 had omitted from his blog, BTW. <img src="https://3dspaint.com/chatroom/smilies/alien1.gif">
<br>
<br>It's also worth mentioning here that there has been a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" rel="nofollow">running gag</a> here on Paint regarding DCTheGamr wearing maid outfits, which <span style="text-decoration:underline">I believe</span> began with <a href="https://3dspaint.com/poll?id=25075" rel="nofollow">this poll</a> of his GF TheAllyWay's (although <span style="font-weight:bold">it might've been going on for even longer than that</span>), and because of that, many community members here have made jokes about maid outfits—many of which were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fairytail/comments/9vvj4m/i_gotta_say_i_question_virgo_more_than_a_lot_of" rel="nofollow">WAY more inappropriate than mine here</a>—although <span style="font-weight:bold">I'm obviously not going to name names here since Thi500 may write another ridiculous blog like this one about them if I do.</span>

<br>(For the record, <span style="font-weight:bold">I do think that maid outfits look ADORABLE, BTW.</span>)

<br>
<br>Also <span style="font-weight:bold">yes, every single one of the people in the conversation shown in the above 2 screenshots (with the possible exception of that “Deleted User” person) was either an active Paint admin (GuiedGui), a former Paint admin (<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=20186" rel="nofollow">poopfart</a>), or an active Overlord on Paint (<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=32808" rel="nofollow">Angelicstarshadow</a> and <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=7900" rel="nofollow">Krovax</a>) at the time.</span> I took these screenshots over on “SDKcord” back when I was still a member there, and these things were actually said there over a year <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/32462ac6-499f-4248-99f8-ba1a3edf0f33.jpg" rel="nofollow">before I ever even had a Discord account</a>, and more importantly, <span style="font-weight:bold">over 2 years before Angela's decision to make me an admin here <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog/view.php?id=100381#:~:text=Draconid_Jo" rel="nofollow">in 2022</a>.</span>
<br>(Apparently she didn't think that me publicly “fetishizing” Zinnia disqualified me from being an admin here. Then again, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=96677" rel="nofollow">she actually</a> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=96417" rel="nofollow">had a</a> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=97072" rel="nofollow">sense of</a> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=98389" rel="nofollow">humor</a>)</span><hr>You’re fucking disgusting. To be honest I always knew you were weird, your insistence on being around kids online is very VERY strange, but I didn’t think you were that mentally fucking braindead to start saying shit like this.<hr><span style="color:cyan">OK, so there's a lot to unpack here. Firstly, he claims that I “[insist] on being around kids online” simply because I <span style="text-decoration:underline">don't</span> insist on avoiding them like <a href="https://snipboard.io/rlKEGt.jpg" rel="nofollow">him</a> (he “[tries] to stay separate from [Paint] because it's all just <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103486" rel="nofollow">right wingers</a> and <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103682" rel="nofollow">children</a> now”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>), <a href="https://controlc.com/7f811895" rel="nofollow">Nikki</a> (she criticizes me because I “[see] <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" rel="nofollow">being friendly with literal children</a> to be completely acceptable”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, whereas <a href="https://snipboard.io/yX57eD.jpg" rel="nofollow">she apparently doesn't</a>), and some of the other “OG” Paint members do. TBH, <span style="font-weight:bold">I've actually never particularly cared about the age of my friends online because they are just that: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship" rel="nofollow">friends</a>.</span>
<br>(Apparently, <span style="font-weight:bold">the word “friends” must mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_with_benefits" rel="nofollow">something else</a> to them</span>, lol!)
<br>
<br><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/456895f2-b1e3-4a6e-bfa0-ea039cc5b1d3.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/456895f2-b1e3-4a6e-bfa0-ea039cc5b1d3.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br>
<br>When he claims that he “always knew” that I was “weird”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>,   <span style="font-weight:bold">this is actually consistent with some of his past remarks about me,</span> such as when he bizarrely accused me of being a teenager and lying about it simply because I had disagreed with his <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/0f6eb493-5bc5-49dd-a592-fca6e82a44fb.jpg" rel="nofollow">bogus excuses</a> for rejecting my blogs, and refused to give in to his repeated <a href="https://snipboard.io/OUhgZt.jpg" rel="nofollow">bullying</a> and <a href="https://snipboard.io/LOM9Na.jpg" rel="nofollow">false accusations</a> against me.
<br>(As you can see, <span style="font-weight:bold">he's only gotten worse.</span>)
<br>
<br><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/d096ec95-0f2a-4fb3-8bc6-63c925a9b7dc.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/d096ec95-0f2a-4fb3-8bc6-63c925a9b7dc.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br>
<br>Of course, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191105192237/https://3dspaint.com/member?id=137730#:~:text=06%20Jul%201994" rel="nofollow">I've always listed my real birthday on my profile here</a> for those who actually bothered to check it, and many months before that bizarre accusation in that blog comment of his, I had written <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=97997" rel="nofollow">this blog</a> in celebration of the 20th anniversary of me playing Pokémon for the first time, which was on <span style="font-weight:bold">July 6th 1999.</span> As can clearly be seen on <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=80730" rel="nofollow">his profile here on Paint</a>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Thi500 was born in 2001.</span>
<br>(In other words: <span style="font-weight:bold">he was a liar back then, too.</span>)
<br>
<br><blockquote>no I deadass thought he was 15/16 until nikki told me he was pushing 30
<br>and his only friends are half his age
<br>fucking pathetic</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/NKTAd1.jpg" rel="nofollow">AaronAstro</a></p>
<br>
<br>He also uses more needlessly cruel and abusive language here as well, by calling me “fucking disgusting” and “mentally fucking braindead”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>. When someone else here had said something similar to this to Nikki—<span style="font-weight:bold">the same Nikki who shamelessly featured this blog of Thi500's</span>—in the past, she had this to say about it:
<br>
<br><blockquote>I can see now that my opinion means so fucking little to the rest of you. This kid has been nothing but&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold">abusive</span>&nbsp;towards me, staff, other users, and users who aren't even on paint, and yet Hullbreach comes in and unbans him,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold">emboldening</span>&nbsp;him to continue being abusive in the future. Did any of you even&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold">read</span>&nbsp;this message and the screenshots I so diligently provided of his behaviour?
<br>
<br><big><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">He called me mentally handicapped. He called me braindead.</span></span>&nbsp;Is that not unacceptable?</big></blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/QbLFoJ.jpg" rel="nofollow">Nikki</a></p>
<br>
<br><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/c66f5404-0d3c-4693-af54-6f8937557001.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/c66f5404-0d3c-4693-af54-6f8937557001.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br>
<br>When I posed the very same question to her regarding Thi500 saying the EXACT same things (<span style="font-weight:bold">only even worse</span>) about me in this blog of his, she told me the following:
<br>
<br><blockquote>Draco. You need to understand that it is his first amendment right to call you whatever name he damn well wants</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/QwTAPg.jpg" rel="nofollow">Nikki</a></p>
<br>
<br>Less than a month after she said this, she was demoted for (among other things) <a href="https://snipboard.io/GcfQT9.jpg" rel="nofollow">threatening to permaban</a> a community member here <span style="font-weight:bold">for stating that they “don't like LGBTQ because they put flags everywhere on June and stole <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209:13-16&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">God's rainbow</a>” <a href="https://snipboard.io/expKkY.jpg" rel="nofollow">in their profile bio</a>.</span> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:37-42&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">So much for all of that “first amendment” BS, lol!</a>
<br>(Just to be clear here, though, <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://3dspaint.com/terms.php#:~:Hate%20speech" rel="nofollow">hate speech</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/terms.php#:~:Harassment" rel="nofollow">harassment</a> and <a href="https://3dspaint.com/terms.php#:~:defamatory" rel="nofollow">defamation</a> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/terms.php#:~:are%20not%20tolerated" rel="nofollow">are not tolerated</a> here on Paint, “first amendment” or not.</span>)
<br>
<br>On a very much related note, later on in this very blog Thi500 says the following:
<br>
<br><blockquote>There’s rumors going around about “corruption” or some shit, none of you have any idea what corruption is. <span style="font-weight:bold">This is part of that “free speech first amendment” thing yall keep yelling about in your stupid political blogs.</span> Stop writing those btw. No one has made a good one yet.</blockquote>
<br>
<br>…Suggesting that <span style="font-weight:bold">he's not exactly the biggest fan of the first amendment either.</span>
<br>(Hypocrisy abounds with these two. <span style="font-weight:bold">They simply say whatever suits them at any given time.</span>)</span><hr>That’s not all for DC’s stupid ass group.

<br>“Spicy emails,” yeah okay admins we’re just gonna let this slide? We’re gonna let this literal children openly mention being sexual online? Listen, im not a moron. They’re growing up, hormones are running rampant, I get it. I was doing the same shit. But why the FUCK is this allowed to be public? Why can’t you keep it to your goddamn selves or at the very least stick to your private real lives? Oh wait, you don’t have any because you’re all too chronically online for that to happen. Silly me!
<br>
<br>“Oh take a joke!” This is not a fucking joke. This is fucking dangerous to be open about this at your age. Especially around people that get “turned on” around you.<hr><span style="color:cyan">Here he complains about “literal children openly [mentioning] being sexual online”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, then acknowledges that he was “doing the same s**t” back when he was a teenager himself—<a href="https://snipboard.io/odliSn.jpg" rel="nofollow">including when he was over 18, BTW</a>—and then says “why the F**K is this allowed to be public” (would it be OK in his view if it was all being said in private in DMs instead?). All of these things <span style="text-decoration:underline">would</span> arguably be valid points if we had been saying things along the lines of what he and some of the other “OG” Paint members had said in Chatroom Jasper during <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/8ef7014d-d748-4085-acd8-460800e36735.jpg" rel="nofollow">his</a> “<a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/30NNW1355G#xgjb3iw5OAr5" rel="nofollow">Nostalgia Night</a>” chatroom events earlier this year, but jokes about “spicy E-mails” and maid outfits being a “turn on” are hardly on the same level as them talking about “<a href="https://snipboard.io/u49ViF.jpg" rel="nofollow">sucking c**k behind an Olive Garden dumpster</a>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, or saying that Jesus Christ “<a href="https://snipboard.io/N7KxPV.jpg" rel="nofollow">likes rock hard pulsating judasc**k</a>” during their “<a href="https://snipboard.io/HV9Atp.jpg" rel="nofollow">CHRISTIAN RP CHAT</a>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>.
<br>
<br>The rationale for this blatant hypocrisy when I had questioned him on it was that the behavior during Nostalgia Night was appropriate for an event of <span style="text-decoration:underline">mostly</span> adults—and to their credit, <a href="https://snipboard.io/DCvOcF.jpg" rel="nofollow">they didn't want children or teens there</a>—in an M-rated chatroom, whereas our remarks were made in a group of <span style="text-decoration:underline">mostly</span> teenagers.
<br>
<br><blockquote>Ah yes dirty jokes in an 18+ chat for adults only oh the horror</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/50HZzf.jpg" rel="nofollow">AaronAstro</a> during an argument with <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=170431" rel="nofollow">Mexican_man</a>, who <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/f050e260-61fe-4a0c-9e46-013eb8fc457d.jpg" rel="nofollow">had every right to complain about this</a>.</p>
<br>
<br>Just to be crystal-clear here, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog/view.php?id=103408#:~:text=Nothing%20should%20be%20AO%2Drated%20%28MPAA%20NC%2D17%29" rel="nofollow">no part of this website</a> is “<a href="https://splicedonline.com/what-does-a-18-rating-mean/#:~:text=The%2018+%20rating%20is%20different%20from%20other%20ratings,%20such%20as%20the%20R%20rating" rel="nofollow">18+</a>” or “<a href="https://videogamegeek.com/videogamerating/2219/esrb-ao#:~:text=The%20content%20can%20feature%20strong%20prolonged%20scenes%20of%20intense%20violence%20or%20graphic%20sexual%20content%20and%20nudity%20that%20exceeds%20what%20the%20&quot;Mature&quot;%20rating%20can%20accommodate" rel="nofollow">adults only</a>”.
<br>(Hence why you don't see something like <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/37f235bb-7643-4dc7-911e-a6a5f8dcfb65.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a> pop up when you try to enter <a href="https://3dspaint.com/chatroom?id=Jasper" rel="nofollow">Chatroom Jasper</a> here.)
<br>
<br>As for his assertion that it is “not a f**king joke”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">it quite literally is one,</span> but since we were all joking about things like maid outfits and “spicy E-mails” instead of things like <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" rel="nofollow">performing oral sex behind a dumpster</a> or <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" rel="nofollow">Jesus Christ having sex</a> with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A70-71&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">Judas Iscariot</a>, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumorDissonance" rel="nofollow">the humor was apparently lost on Thi500</a>. Furthermore, while his claim that it “is f**king dangerous to be open about [sex] at [their] age” <span style="text-decoration:underline">would</span> be a valid one, he immediately ruined whatever valid point he may have had there by instead using this argument to take another cheap shot at me by (once again) <a href="https://lawslearned.com/defamation-by-implication" rel="nofollow">implying that I am a pedophile</a>, saying “especially around people that get “turned on” around you”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>.
<br>(Which is, of course, a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubtletyFailure" rel="nofollow">very obvious</a> reference to <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/b15b3346-4c41-4d20-bbf1-d3f7e94065f6.jpg" rel="nofollow">my shout</a> that he had shown earlier in the blog.)</span><hr>Reminder that Drac is pushing 30.

<br>So… you say he’s mentally challenged, so that excuses this? You’re a moron. But I guess that’s just what the admin team has turned into now.<hr><span style="color:cyan">First of all, it is worth mentioning that my initial reaction to this (back in April 2024) was <span style="font-weight:bold">to thank <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=84791" rel="nofollow">Randy</a> for defending me here: </span>

<br>2. Helping me to set up <a href="https://x.com/DraconidJoashu" rel="nofollow">my Twitter account</a> afterwards, so that I had a way to reliably contact HullBreach about admin stuff.
<br>(I didn't have a phone of my own at the time, and he helped me with the phone verification part.)
<br>
<br>3. Sending me a SIM card—which <span style="font-weight:bold">I am using to access the internet RN, actually</span>—so that I didn't have to rely on my (WAY slower) <a href="https://www.firsty.app/plans/firsty-free" rel="nofollow">Firsty Free</a> internet to get online.
<br>(Although I could always use the hotspot that <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=152737" rel="nofollow">MattTheTekie</a> gave me as well.)
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">...My feelings about his handling of admin matters here on Paint in recent months have been mixed, to say the least.</span>
<br>
<br>Firstly, <span style="font-weight:bold">he is a bit to eager to defend hate speech being posted on the site IMO</span>—which he actually shows in this conversation with Nikki here as well, when he tells her to “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/0b0e0821-0adc-4446-b1a4-a9b34be8257d.jpg" rel="nofollow">just let shit go lmao</a>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>—and he has also claimed (much more recently) that I am not only “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/14nc7v1/does_anyone_else_feel_like_theyre_mentally_behind" rel="nofollow">mentally behind</a>” but that I am also “<a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/intellectual-disability/what-is-intellectual-disability" rel="nofollow">mentally disabled</a>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">and that because of said “disability” I am “unqualified” to be an admin here.</span>
<br>(Which I will address in more detail later on here, <span style="font-weight:bold">once I get the part of this blog where Thi500 does the same thing.</span>)
<br>
<br>As for the rest of what was said here by Randy, he is absolutely correct here when he asserts that “it'd be drastically different” if I had said anything along the lines of what Nikki had <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/false_equivalence" rel="nofollow">falsely</a> claimed that I had said, <span style="font-weight:bold">hence why she always feels the need to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/twist_someone%27s_words" rel="nofollow">twist my words around</a> and lie about <a href="https://crossidiomas.com/turn-https://crossidiomas.com/turn-on/on" rel="nofollow">what I had actually said</a>,</span> in order to make her completely baseless “pedophilia” allegations against me sound like they have some validity to them when <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">they don't</span>.</span>
<br>
<br>When I had pointed out how literally every underage community member here who I showed <a href="http://digitalcheese.xyz/uwu/thi500-blog.html" rel="nofollow">DC's archived copy of Thi500's blog</a> to didn't come to any of the same ridiculous conclusions about me that her and Thi500 did, she said this:
<br>
<br><blockquote>That is because underage minors do not have the mental capacity to understand what grooming looks like</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/HT7JrK.jpg" rel="nofollow">Nikki</a></p>
<br>
<br>Later during that same conversation she also said accused me of <a href="https://snipboard.io/zfD4yj.jpg" rel="nofollow">“grooming” Tulips</a>—“Tulips” here referring to my BFF <a href="https://3dspaint.com/poll?id=24573" rel="nofollow">UwUQueen</a>—who as I had previously mentioned <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/1b3ca57a-2766-4ef4-a140-90c67db588fc.jpg" rel="nofollow">is an adult</a>.
<br>
<br><blockquote>"Drac, you're grooming <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=116525" rel="nofollow">that 20s something woman</a> by <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103215" rel="nofollow">agreeing with her</a>, and '<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=150961" rel="nofollow">innocent 14 year old</a>' who's also secretly grooming everyone on Paint into being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240420101141/https://digitalcheese.xyz/a/sdk/blogs/101830" rel="nofollow">nazis</a>.

<br>
<br>Of course, <span style="font-weight:bold">Nikki knows damned well that the EXACT same <a href="https://xtramagazine.com/power/politics/court-groomer-slur-261318" rel="nofollow">language</a> and <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argumentum_ex_culo" rel="nofollow">BS logic</a> that she has been using against me here has <span style="text-decoration:underline">consistently</span> been <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog/view.php?id=102176#:~:text=Sexualization%20of%20Children" rel="nofollow">weaponized by Nazis and Fascists against 2SLGBTQIA+ people for decades</a>,</span> and yet she seems to have no reservations whatsoever about doing so herself to me, <span style="font-weight:bold">all because she's still pissed about me sticking up for DCTheGamr <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101118" rel="nofollow">when she had wanted to permaban him before</a>, and she obviously wants revenge for it.</span>
<br>
<br><blockquote>[DCTheGamr's] continued existence as long as he intends to insult me is detrimental to my own well-being. If you're going to advocate for paint over me, I don't quite like that</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/OcgUMV.jpg" rel="nofollow">Nikki,</a> in response to me saying that “a weeklong ban is more than sufficient” to punish DCTheGamr for his bullying of her at the time.</p>
<br>
<br>For her to suggest that me joking about being “turned on” by imagining a video game character wearing a maid outfit is in any way comparable to the evils of actual pedophilia and grooming is absolutely disgusting. <span style="font-weight:bold">I have a number of friends here who were <span style="text-decoration:underline">victims of actual pedophiles</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">every single one of them</span> <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Irony" rel="nofollow">thinks that what Thi500 and Nikki did to me is absolutely disgusting and evil</a>.</span>

<br>
<br><span style="color:cyan">After Thi500 reported my shouts to the admins, I got this DM from <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=7900" rel="nofollow">Divine Crusader</a> on Discord, telling me to “be mindful of the way [I] handle conversations like this. Considering they are kids.<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>” Given that all of this was a <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=95552" rel="nofollow">whole lot of Hoopa</a> over a single slightly inappropriate joke that I made about a video game character, <span style="font-weight:bold">that was the only thing that <span style="text-decoration:underline">should've</span> actually ”happened” as a result of him reporting it.</span>
<br>(Although <span style="font-weight:bold">Thi500 obviously disagreed with Divine Crusader's original decision,</span> hence posting this blog to get me demodded <span style="font-weight:bold">8 days later.</span>)</span><hr>Furthermore, if he’s like you say, “mentally behind,” WHY IN THE HOLY MOTHER OF FUCK IS HE AN ADMIN???
<br>
<br>You’re okay with giving him powers while acknowledging he’s not all there? What the fuck is wrong with you guys??<hr><span style="color:cyan">OK, now here's where he crosses (yet another) line, and starts promoting <span style="font-weight:bold">overt <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ableism" rel="nofollow">ableism</a>.</span>
<br>
<br>Although the term Randy used—which is also repeated by Thi500 here—is “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/14nc7v1/does_anyone_else_feel_like_theyre_mentally_behind" rel="nofollow">mentally behind</a>”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, which Randy described like:
<br>
<br><blockquote>HE'S LITERALLY MENTALLY BEHIND
<br>WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
<br><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">he's mentally a teenager</span>
<br>He never had fucking friends
<br>He's never lived life</span></blockquote>
<br>
<br>Which <span style="text-decoration:underline">doesn't</span> imply some sort of unnamed mental disability, but rather, <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=100078" rel="nofollow">a relative lack of maturity for my age</a>, due to a lack of real world experience.</span> Although myself and others may here dispute this characterization in certain respects as well, <span style="font-weight:bold">at least there is a sound logic to it.</span>
<br>
<br>Thi500 here uses this phrase quite differently than Randy did in his defense of me, however, as proven by him also stating that I am “<a href="https://jacobin.com/2020/03/joe-biden-gaffes-democratic-presidential-campaign-trump" rel="nofollow">not all there</a>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, and also suggesting that I am somehow unfit to be a blogmin/pollmin—<span style="font-weight:bold">which were the only admin powers that I had at this point in time, BTW</span>—based on these things.
<br>
<br>If I am indeed “mentally a teenager”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, the logical question to ask here would be <span style="font-weight:bold">can teenagers be good admins?</span> IMO, <span style="font-weight:bold">the answer is an <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=170335" rel="nofollow">obvious yes</a>,</span> since I don't share the same <a href="https://www.ageism.org/how-does-ageism-impact-young-people-too" rel="nofollow">ageist</a> way of thinking about the teenage community members that Thi500 and Nikki obviously have.
<br>
<br><blockquote>…In public discourse and medical practices, <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">ageist assumptions about adolescents</span> (e.g., that they are immature and cognitively underdeveloped) are used to falsely portray transgender and gender nonbinary adolescents as incapable of gender self-identification, which invalidates their gender identities, limits their access to supportive care, and reinforces transphobia</span> (Hall <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdep.12540#cdep12540-bib-0038" rel="nofollow">2021</a>; Pitts-Taylor <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdep.12540#cdep12540-bib-0063" rel="nofollow">2020</a>; Rubinsky and Cooke-Jackson <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdep.12540#cdep12540-bib-0068" rel="nofollow">2021</a>). These examples illustrate how <span style="font-weight:bold">cultural ageism is often interwoven with cultural racism and cis-heterosexism, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">embedded in societal beliefs that can systematically harm adolescents and threaten their well-being</span>.</span></blockquote><p style="text-align:right"><a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdep.12540" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p>
<br>
<br>In short, <span style="font-weight:bold">all of this ageist nonsense is actually harmful to teenagers.</span> Teens obviously <span style="text-decoration:underline">do</span> need to be protected from <span style="text-decoration:underline">genuine</span> threats like <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=32401" rel="nofollow">cyberbullying</a>,  <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/f050e260-61fe-4a0c-9e46-013eb8fc457d.jpg" rel="nofollow">actual pedophilia</a>, and <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=99739" rel="nofollow">actual grooming</a>, but <span style="text-decoration:underline">NOT</span> “man-children” telling questionable jokes about video game characters wearing maid outfits.</span><hr>Now, is he a pedophile? Hard to say. Not really my place. That’s up to the court of public opinion. I actually 100% agree with Randy when he says he’s mentally behind.
<br>
<br>Someone like this should not be around children much less help run a website that’s mostly populated by children. Why is this so hard to understand??!<hr><span style="color:cyan">Now, <span style="font-weight:bold">this is where he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability" rel="nofollow">attempts to cover his own ass</a>,</span> by claiming that <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Bullshit" rel="nofollow">it is “hard to say” whether or not I am a pedophile</a>, and that it is “up to <a href="https://www.equaljusticeproject.co.nz/articles/2018/07/amicus-curiae-can-anyone-ever-win-in-the-court-of-public-opinion" rel="nofollow">the court of public opinion</a>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">rather than a <a href="https://www.brunolawoffices.com/articles/accusations-of-pedophilia" rel="nofollow">court of law</a>.</span>

<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">This is a disgusting, cowardly, and underhanded tactic.</span> Rather than just coming out and saying that he thinks I am a pedophile, <span style="font-weight:bold">he just <span style="text-decoration:underline">REPEATEDLY</span> implies it throughout this blog,</span> but then puts this little disclaimer in there so that he can deny that he ever actually said that I was one. <span style="font-weight:bold">This is called <a href="https://lawslearned.com/defamation-by-implication" rel="nofollow">defamation by implication</a>,</span> which is when you try to get people to believe something nasty about someone without explicitly saying that it is true yourself.

<br>
<br>According to Thi500 almost a year after he wrote this blog (see the screenshot above), there's “legitimate pedophilia allegations with screenshot evidence” against me—<span style="font-weight:bold">allegations that he himself made in this blog, with “screenshot evidence” that he himself took and posted in this blog as well</span>—and yet he insists that he didn't call me a pedophile? <span style="font-weight:bold">Any sane, unbiased person can see through his pathetic little <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Weasel_word" rel="nofollow">weasel words</a> here.</span>
<br>
<br>It's also worth noting here that he did the EXACT same thing with his baseless allegations that <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=150961" rel="nofollow">DCTheGamr</a> was <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103759" rel="nofollow">Aryan</a>.

<br><blockquote>…DC could be <a href="http://digitalcheese.xyz/uwu/cui-bono.html" rel="nofollow">the one making nazi related alt accounts to spam the website</a>, although there is nothing directly linking the two together, nor is it relevant to the situation at hand.

<br><small>Remember: this kid is a “<a href="https://snipboard.io/8h6EHI.jpg" rel="nofollow">LITERAL NAZI</a>” according to Thi500.</small>
<br>
<br>As you can see, <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/DARVO" rel="nofollow">DARVO</a> is Thi500's <a href="https://www.grammar-monster.com/Latin_terms/mo.htm" rel="nofollow">MO</a>.</span>
<br>
<br><blockquote>Ever felt like someone twisted the truth to make themselves look better? You might have encountered DARVO — a sneaky tactic that manipulative individuals use to flip the script.

<br>DARVO stands for:

<br>
<br>Although that link talks about DARVO in the context of abusive romantic relationships—rather than <span style="font-weight:bold">abusive workplace ones</span>—astute readers will note that <span style="font-weight:bold">these same techniques are used by <a href="https://armoxon.substack.com/p/bully-tactics" rel="nofollow">Fascists</a> to demonize the minorities that they persecute,</span> and they are in fact used by all sorts of abusive manipulative people in all sorts of different situations, <span style="font-weight:bold">including by Thi500 here.</span></span><hr>He’s condescending to everyone he speaks to. He constantly belittles everyone around him. He doesn’t fucking stop. He’s the VERY SAME ARCHETYPE AS ME back when I was admin. Do we need a reminder of why I was so disliked?

<br>
<br><span style="color:cyan">Out of all of the outrageous and disgusting lies peddled in Thi500's evil blog, perhaps the one with the least basis in actual reality is his completely absurd claim that I am “the VERY SAME ARCHETYPE AS [him] back when [he] was admin.<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>”
<br>
<br><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/370d3603-d5f3-4e4b-9ef3-f546514e9dc3.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/370d3603-d5f3-4e4b-9ef3-f546514e9dc3.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br>
<br>Unsurprisingly, <span style="font-weight:bold">this lie can easily be disproven.</span> In <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=102788" rel="nofollow">this blog</a> of <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=170335" rel="nofollow">Amjam's</a>, we can see that there are (at present) <span style="font-weight:bold">29 signatures</span> from active community members here voting for me to be made an Overlord here, and as can be seen on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241226151358/https://3dspaint.com/blog/view.php?id=102788" rel="nofollow">Wayback Machine</a>, <span style="font-weight:bold">we were able to get <span style="text-decoration:underline">over 30 signatures</span> in <span style="text-decoration:underline">less than 2 months</span>,</span> which is a pretty remarkable accomplishment on a “dead website” to say the least, <span style="font-weight:bold">kinda like having the 6th most popular group with over <span style="text-decoration:underline">220</span> members.</span>
<br>
<br>Did I become so well-liked by the community here by being “condescending to everyone [I speak] to” and “constantly [belittling] everyone around [me]”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>? <span style="font-weight:bold">Obviously not, and Thi500 obviously realizes this as well.</span>
<br>
<br>By comparison, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=96316" rel="nofollow">this effort</a> to make Thi500 an Overlord back in 2017 got support from only <span style="text-decoration:underline">3</span> community members, at a time when (AFAIK) the site was supposed to be far more active. Also, here are 2 (blatantly <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cherry_picking" rel="nofollow">cherry-picked</a>) excerpts of <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=98384" rel="nofollow">Member Appreciation Day</a> messages for Thi500 from back in 2019 to help me make my point here:
<br>
<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight:bold">Somehow you have a history of getting about half the site to hate you…</span></blockquote>
<br>
<br><blockquote>…<span style="font-weight:bold">you're the type of person that presents their opinions as fact,</span> your words are v e r y convincing. this is honestly too much power for one single man to have. … you're definitely a good man, <span style="font-weight:bold">even if some people find that hard to believe.</span></blockquote>
<br>
<br>Obviously, <span style="font-weight:bold">Thi500 has plenty of people that like him now, particularly over on “SDKcord”</span>, but it is he himself that is claiming here that he “was a fucking dick and an idiot” <span style="text-decoration:underline">in the past</span>, and that that's “why [he] was so disliked” <span style="text-decoration:underline">back then</span>, but obviously, <span style="font-weight:bold">none of that is applicable to me in the past, present, or future.</span> Is it applicable to him in the present, however? <span style="font-weight:bold">I'd argue that this blog of his is actually the best evidence that <span style="text-decoration:underline">it is</span>.</span></span><hr>Yeah let’s just casually compare a normal ass person concerned about his childhood home to Hitler.

<br>
<br><blockquote>Me: Speaking of which, <span style="font-weight:bold">I'd like to apologize to you for the Hitler remarks</span>.

<br>
<br>Of course, <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nazi_analogies" rel="nofollow">comparing people that you strongly dislike to Hitler is a thing</a>, and just 10 days prior to me comparing Thi500 to Hitler, I had compared then-presidential candidate <a href="https://en.prolewiki.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" rel="nofollow">Donald Trump</a> to Hitler in <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101768" rel="nofollow">one of my blogs</a>:
<br>
<br><blockquote>I wonder if the Republican candidate was <a href="https://en.prolewiki.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" rel="nofollow">Adolf Hitler</a> and the Democratic candidate was <a href="https://en.prolewiki.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill" rel="nofollow">Winston Churchill</a>—who, like Hitler, was a <a href="https://yourstory.com/2014/08/bengal-famine-genocide" rel="nofollow">genocidal white supremacist himself</a>—if people would still be saying to vote for the "lesser evil"? How evil does a person have to be before we are unwilling to vote for them? Do they have to openly support genocide? Because if so, <a href="https://www.lemkininstitute.com/statements-new-page/statement-on-why-we-call-the-israeli-attack-on-gaza-genocide" rel="nofollow">we're already there</a>.</blockquote>
<br>
<br>Obviously, <span style="font-weight:bold">Donald Trump has far more in common with Hitler than Thi500 does,</span> but as I already alluded to earlier in this commentary, <span style="font-weight:bold">Thi500's baseless pedophilia allegations against me in this  blog are actually incredibly similar to <a href="https://pineandroses.org/culture/fascist-origins-of-the-groomer-panic" rel="nofollow">disgusting tactics used by Nazis against 2SLGBTQIA+ people</a>.</span> <img src="https://3dspaint.com/chatroom/smilies/alien2.gif">
<br>(Which is obviously more than a bit ironic: <span style="font-weight:bold">I called him a Nazi, and then he started actually behaving like one.</span>.)</span><hr>This is how this weirdo operates. Note the boldface and insistence on "lol!" after every sentence. He treats casual conversation like a god damn english class essay. "Older members abandoned paint," Fuck you. No one "abandoned" anything. We grew up, we got older. Got jobs. Got families, friends, and most importantly, got LIVES. But yeah we "abandoned" it. Do I abandon every bodega and pizza joint I visit just because I don't want to be there 24/7? No, thats fucking stupid.

Anyway, since his screenshot here is blurry, this is what's shown in it:
<br>
<br><blockquote>AaronAstro: I sincerely doubt theres anything interesting going on in groups lets be real
<br>
<br>🦈🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — 01/22/2024 5:29 AM
<br>You're not a member of any groups made this decade (the 2020s), so you wouldn't know, lol!
<br>(And your friends list is probably stuck in the previous decade as well.)
<br>
<br>The real problem is (like I said before) the old members abandoned Paint and then some people they don't like very much came to fill the void that they themselves created.  They may refuse to accept reality, <span style="font-weight:bold">but that doesn't change it.</span>
<br>(If there wasn't any activity over there, I wouldn't spend WAY more time over there than on my own Discord server, lol!)</blockquote>
<br>
<br>Regardless of what your opinion is about what I said here, <span style="font-weight:bold">this is obviously how I feel about this subject, and I still feel that way about it.</span> Also, since I said this over on SDKcord, <span style="font-weight:bold">it has no relevance whatsoever to my conduct as an admin here on Paint.</span></span><hr>Another thing I wanted to highlight was the insane disrespect of admin yaynikki. You assholes continuously made her feel like shit for doing nothing but the right thing. I don’t know what goes on in the “senate” but the disrespect in a place where you’re all supposed to work together is downright embarrassing on your part, admin team. She’s done so much for yall including sacrificing her mental health to keep helping YOU out. Not for herself, for YOU. What a fucking joke. Do better.
<br>
<br>Oh, Draccy-boy also knew of a previously perma banned member and said nothing, essentially harboring a literal Nazi. Fun!
<br>
<br><p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://controlc.com/e58f3141" rel="nofollow">Discord logs from the admin server. He KNEW that there was someone evading a permaban and was completely silent.</a>
<br>
<br><a href="https://controlc.com/7f811895" rel="nofollow">Wow! The disrespect is crazy.</a>
<br>
<br><a href="https://controlc.com/fff31dca" rel="nofollow">Some more crazy disrespect. And somehow I get still get talked about. Do they usually mention me?</a></p><hr><span style="color:cyan">OK, this is where he—with “explicit permission” and assistance from Nikki—commits <span style="font-weight:bold">the biggest leak of private admin conversations to non-admins in Paint history.</span>
<br>
<br>Putting aside the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold">this was done in blatant violation of admin rules established (and <a href="https://snipboard.io/p4q23l.jpg" rel="nofollow">clarified shortly before this</a>) by Angela and Hull,</span> there is also the glaring discrepancy between the way that Thi500 (mis)characterizes what is in the logs he leaked and what is actually in them.
<br>
<br>For those unable to use the links above, DC also archived the leaked admin logs <a href="http://digitalcheese.xyz/owo/thi500-blog/leaked-logs.txt" rel="nofollow">here on his website</a>, and I <span style="text-decoration:underline">strongly</span> encourage you to go through them yourself. A few key points regarding them:
<br>
<br>1. Literally the first thing shown in the logs is me reporting blueturtle:
<br>
<br><blockquote>🦈🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Yesterday at 10:16 PM
<br>My friend R1N1K4 reported that a grouo of PecanPenguin's has a lot of hate speech and neo-Nazi content in it.
<br>(And I'm a member of the group too, and I can confirm this.)

<br>(CONTAINS WW2, first time doing a political rant btw)  By R1N1K4
<br>3DSPaint: Games and Apps for the Nintendo 3DS Internet Browser</blockquote>
<br>
<br>2. Back then I was <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> a blogmin and pollmin, and so <span style="font-weight:bold">I couldn't actually ban people.</span> Despite this fact, this is Nikki's first response to me reporting the Nazism:
<br>
<br><blockquote>Nikki — Today at 1:27 PM
<br>You're fucking incompetent, Draconid. You're not supposed to be cozying up with members especially if they're fucking nazis. I guess since you're not going to do shit about it, I will.</blockquote>
<br>
<br>“Wow! The disrespect is crazy.” Of course, <span style="font-weight:bold">it's blatantly obvious that Nikki and Thi500 don't believe that I deserve the same respect that they do.</span> <img src="https://3dspaint.com/chatroom/smilies/alien2.gif">
<br>
<br>3. Although Thi500 remarks “And somehow I get still get talked about. Do they usually mention me?<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>” here, what either he or (more likely) Nikki does here is <span style="font-weight:bold">deliberately leave out where <span style="text-decoration:underline">Nikki</span> mentions Thi500 as a potential “replacement” for me from the admin logs.</span>
<br>
<br>The part in <span style="font-weight:bold">boldface</span> here was omitted from the 2nd set of admin logs in Thi500's blog:
<br>
<br><blockquote>LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:16 PM
<br>May I recommend, then, we find a replacement rather than hotheadedly ejecting the man?
<br>
<br>Nikki — Today at 4:17 PM
<br>Hotheadedly? No, this has been brewing for some time. I've long been dissatisfied with draconid's conduct. If you have an idea for a replacement, by all means suggest it
<br>
<br>LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:17 PM
<br>Hotheaded, yes
<br>[4:18 PM]
<br>I have no replacement, so that's why I am against purely removing him
<br>
<br>Nikki — Today at 4:18 PM
<br>If you have an idea for a replacement, by all means suggest it
<br>[4:18 PM]
<br>By all means just ignore most of my messages /shrug
<br>
<br>LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:18 PM
<br>mfw "if"
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Nikki — Today at 4:41 PM
<br>AaronAstro/Thi500. That's my suggestion.
<br>
<br>LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:46
<br>So long as they're active on-site</span></blockquote>
<br>
<br>By deliberately leaving this part out, <span style="font-weight:bold">they make it appear as though I was bringing up Thi500 for no reason in the 3rd set of admin logs.</span> This is yet another example of them intentionally taking things out of context to push their <span style="text-decoration:underline">false</span> narrative: <span style="font-weight:bold">that I have an irrational hatred of Thi500 because of him being a jerk to me back in 2019.</span>
<br>(I will address that narrative in more detail later on.)
<br>
<br>4. Shortly before Nikki decides to instigate more drama because of me stating the obvious—that <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=169127" rel="nofollow">.___.</a> was a <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=163404#:~:text=blueturtle" rel="nofollow">Croc/blueturtle</a> alt—I say the following:
<br>
<br><blockquote>🦈🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:13 PM
<br>For all IK PecanPenguin is just another Croc alt, or perhaps a RL friend of his.
<br>(Supposedly Pecan is female.)</blockquote>
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">…And this is completely ignored.</span> Worse still, something that is completely omitted from these logs is <span style="font-weight:bold">how Nikki completely disregarded and <span style="text-decoration:underline">even deleted</span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240420101141/https://digitalcheese.xyz/a/sdk/blogs/101830" rel="nofollow">DC's blog</a>, where he <span style="text-decoration:underline">explicity states</span> that the group's owner “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=167404" rel="nofollow">PecanPenguin</a>” was Croc.</span>
<br>(Which ultimately <span style="font-weight:bold">allowed Croc/blueturtle/Aryan to remain on Paint for <span style="text-decoration:underline">a whole month longer</span>.</span>)
<br>
<br><a href="https://controlc.com/4d32a0c0" rel="nofollow">Nikki KNEW that DC exposed PecanPenguin's Nazism, but she just covered it up and ignored him anyway.</a>

<br>First of all, <span style="font-weight:bold">at the time that Thi500 wrote this blog, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101818" rel="nofollow">PecanPenguin's group</a> <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> still around because of Nikki,</span> so he's dead wrong there. Secondly, the CSS was obviously the group owner's doing, and wasn't done for the purpose of concealing <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=145053" rel="nofollow">royal rawr's</a> identity, nor did it do so. Thirdly, he (once again) takes an isolated shout COMPLETELY out of context to make it sound worse than it actually is, although even if it is taken out of context like this, in this shout of <a href="https://3dspaint.com/group/members.php?id=12906" rel="nofollow">my fellow AnCom</a> royal-rawr he isn't actually saying anything problematic, <span style="font-weight:bold">he's literally just arguing against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum" rel="nofollow">Reductio ad Hitlerum</a>.</span>
<br>
<br>The below screenshot shows his shout in the context in which it was said.

<br>
<br>Although this <span style="text-decoration:underline">should've</span> been purely a touching eulogy to honor the memory of our dear friend Angela, <span style="font-weight:bold">he shamelessly inserts not-so subtle innuendo about his feelings regarding the present state of things here on Paint into it.</span>“It didn't take long for Paint to fall?” <span style="font-weight:bold">Paint is still right here.</span> “Our victory was so close?” <span style="font-weight:bold">What exactly does he mean by “victory” here? <span style="text-decoration:underline">Getting DCTheGamr permabanned</span>?</span>

Oh, and some advice, religion and theology has no place in government so if your political stance is religion based, sorry pal, you’re kinda doing it wrong.<hr><span style="color:cyan">What he is (mostly) referring to here is <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=164130" rel="nofollow">Wesley388's</a> (now deleted) blog <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101840" rel="nofollow">Corruption in Administrators: The fall of Paint, 1984, First Attempt. SPC</a>, which I will include in its entirety here:
<br>
<br><blockquote>It has probably come to your attention that the most active blogmin/pollmin @Draconid_Jo has been under fire for various reasons, including not ratting out a ban dodger.
<br>
<br>I say we must keep Drac in power, keep the person who has been nominated to be admin, @THI300, from being and admin based on information provided to me by multiple anonymous sources, and last but not least strip @yaynikki of their admin powers.
<br>
<br>First, Drac has been a good blogmin and pollmin, but the fact he has some admin powers does not mean it is his responsibility to rat out ban dodgers who should have been found by others (others who refused to close a group with nazi symbolism and sexually explicit content).
<br>
<br>Second, I must continue my investigation into the THI300 situation, so I will not be one hundred percent on my position of keeping THI from being an admin until further notice.
<br>
<br>Lastly, nikki has been a corrupt admin for some time. Examples include but are not limited to, not featuring blogs/polls based on personal issues, kicking/banning members from chatrooms based on false accusations, and threatening members with bans based on personal issues. This blog may not be featured because of the section.

<br>
<br>Of course, <span style="font-weight:bold">Thi500 is also presumably referring to some of my political blogs here,</span> although he has admitted on multiple occasions that <span style="font-weight:bold">he doesn't actually read any of them.</span>
<br>
<br><blockquote>i dont care about his blogs i dont read them
<br>shit hes said in the discord about gun control, abortion, and third parties which have always been incorrect</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://snipboard.io/gc5kXK.jpg" rel="nofollow">AaronAstro</a></p>
<br>
<br>As I mentioned earlier, Thi500 is “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog/view.php?id=98384#:~:text=the%20type%20of%20person%20that%20presents%20their%20opinions%20as%20fact" rel="nofollow">the type of person that presents their opinions as fact</a>”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, but unfortunately for him, <span style="font-weight:bold">facts and opinions are 2 completely different things.</span>
<br>
<br><blockquote>An&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold">opinion</span>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement" rel="nofollow">judgement</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy)" rel="nofollow">viewpoint</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition" rel="nofollow">statement</a>&nbsp;that is not conclusive, as opposed to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact" rel="nofollow">facts</a>, which are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth" rel="nofollow">true</a>&nbsp;statements.
<br>
<br>…Distinguishing fact from opinion is that facts are verifiable, i.e. can be agreed to by the consensus of experts. An example is: "United States of America was involved in the Vietnam War," versus "United States of America was right to get involved in the Vietnam War". An opinion may be supported by facts and principles, in which case it becomes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument" rel="nofollow">argument</a>.</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a></p>
<br>
<br><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/e4762b3c-e2bb-4049-aff5-ec2601e63deb.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/e4762b3c-e2bb-4049-aff5-ec2601e63deb.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br>
<br>For example, Thi500 can disagree with my <span style="text-decoration:underline">opinions</span> regarding “gun control, abortion, and third parties”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>—such as those that I expressed over 3 years ago on Discord, part of which are shown in the screenshot above—but <span style="font-weight:bold">that <span style="text-decoration:underline">doesn't</span> make any of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">facts</span> that I stated as the basis for said opinions or those expressed in my political blogs “incorrect” or “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/0f6eb493-5bc5-49dd-a592-fca6e82a44fb.jpg" rel="nofollow">misinformation</a>” like he regularly claims.</span>
<br>
<br><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/48897c6f-76dc-4bb7-89c8-154f53cf3486.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/48897c6f-76dc-4bb7-89c8-154f53cf3486.jpg" alt="thumb"></a> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/86ba5952-09a3-4a8c-8022-9845fdd393d7.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/86ba5952-09a3-4a8c-8022-9845fdd393d7.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br>
<br>For example, when I pointed out the <span style="text-decoration:underline">fact</span> that far more abortions occur in this country than the number of injuries caused by gun violence, he said “where tf are you getting that info because thats the most insane lie ive ever seen”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">only for me to be proven correct by a pro-choice, pro-gun control friend of mine the very next day.</span>
<br>(Yet almost 3 years later, <span style="font-weight:bold">he is still repeating the same easily disproven lies.</span>)

<br>
<br>With regards to his assertion that “if your political stance is religion based, sorry pal, you’re kinda doing it wrong”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt here and assume that this statement of his <span style="text-decoration:underline">doesn't</span> apply to <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=102176" rel="nofollow">my Christianity based support for 2SLGBTQIA+ rights</a> or <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101768" rel="nofollow">my Christianity based opposition to Donald Trump</a>.
<br>(<span style="font-weight:bold">He doesn't actually read any of my political blogs, after all.</span>)
<br>
<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">As a Christian</span>, a pro-lifer, and a friend of countless LGBTQIA+ people here on Paint, I cannot condone <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/1/31/2150386/-Trump-proposes-genocidal-national-ban-on-transgender-existence-if-he-wins-2024" rel="nofollow">this genocide</a>,</span> and it is this issue that ultimately made me unwilling to continue to support former President Trump like I have in the past.</blockquote><p style="text-align:right">—<a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101768" rel="nofollow">Draconid_Jo</a></p></span><hr>I’m sharing all this because I’m fed up. I’m fed up with the way this place has fallen. I’m fed up with all the shit that continues to be allowed to happen. I’M FED UP WITH OUR CHILDHOOD HOME BECOMING A BREEDING GROUND FOR NAZIS AND PEDOPHILES.
<br>
<br>Ohhh god no this isn’t the first time we’ve had one, but with any luck, it will be the last<hr><span style="color:cyan">When he says here “ohhh god no this isn’t the first time we’ve had one”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">he is obviously referring to pedophiles, and (once again) implying that I am one</span>—unless he suddenly decided that I am a “NAZI” as well here. More specifically, however, <span style="font-weight:bold">it is obvious that he is referring to <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=99739" rel="nofollow">this situation</a> with former Paint admin <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=133688" rel="nofollow">SkulHedFace</a>, and that <span style="text-decoration:underline">he is directly comparing me to SkulHedFace here</span>.</span>
<br>
<br><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/302e302f-812e-46c6-bc33-95cd895be074.jpg"><img src="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/302e302f-812e-46c6-bc33-95cd895be074.jpg" alt="thumb"></a>
<br>
<br>Once again, despite this all being completely obvious to anyone remotely familiar with the SkulHedFace situation who reads Thi500's crappy blog, <span style="font-weight:bold">he later claimed that he “never compared [me] to anyone”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>,</span> as can be seen in the screenshot above.
<br>(Needless to say, <span style="font-weight:bold">he never reread this disgusting blog of his like I kept telling him to do back then either.</span>)
<br>
<br>Also, obviously, his baseless claim that Paint is “BECOMING A BREEDING GROUND FOR NAZIS AND PEDOPHILES” is absolutely absurd, <span style="font-weight:bold">in spite of <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103759" rel="nofollow">blueturtle's latest schtick</a>.</span>
<br>(The term “BREEDING GROUND” implies that there is more than one, <span style="font-weight:bold">but there isn't.</span>)</span><hr>Admins, I’m willing to work with you to clean up all the shit going wrong as I should have done from the beginning. I gave you my word that I would come back if I was needed. As much as I hate the idea of it, if you want me back on the team, I won’t decline. You know where to find me.<hr><span style="color:cyan">Although he says “as much as I hate the idea of it” here, <span style="font-weight:bold">it is obvious to anyone that he is begging for his admin powers to be restored here.</span> Eventually, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/8ef7014d-d748-4085-acd8-460800e36735.jpg" rel="nofollow">that actually happened</a>—shortly before he used his newly restored chatmin powers to set up the <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/30NNW1355G#xgjb3iw5OAr5" rel="nofollow">Nostalgia Night</a> chatroom events—up until his demotion less than 4 months later <span style="text-decoration:underline">by HullBreach</span>, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250701031730/https://3dspaint.com/member/?id=80730#:~:text=30%20May%202025" rel="nofollow">May 29th</a>, after which he was completely inactive here on Paint up until <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=80730" rel="nofollow">August 7th</a>, when he logged in to deactivate his account.
<br>(Similar to what he did back on <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/e42c91b5-fa42-4036-986f-52194cf9c3e1.jpg" rel="nofollow">December 15th</a>, about a week after I was given Overlord powers by Hull.</span>)</span><hr>And for the people out there that keep spreading rumors about me and keep saying about how I’m so terrible, none of you have actually met me and your information is about four years out of date, and just straight up false in most cases, like a multiple year long game of telephone. Stop the presses, people change, people grow. I’m not a bad guy. I’m quite literally just a normal dude.
<br>
<br>But of course, all of this is gonna fall on deaf ears and be completely ignored because “thi=bad lol!” Literally wouldn’t even be surprised if even after I air all this out, nothing changes and we forget about it in a week. I’ll be disappointed, but not surprised in the slightest.<hr><span style="color:cyan">Here he tries to belittle all of the completely legitimate criticisms of his morally abhorrent behavior—the very same behavior that is most clearly observed in this very blog, ironically—as mere “rumors"<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, and tries to make these legitimate criticisms out to be about something else entirely: <span style="font-weight:bold">his questionable conduct as an admin back in 2019-2020.</span>
<br>
<br>Obviously, <span style="font-weight:bold">I do have issues with some of what Thi500 did back then,</span> and would even go as far as to say that some of it—such as his repeated rejections of blogs of mine <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">that other blogmins were willing to feature</span></span>—constituted an abuse of his admin powers. <span style="text-decoration:underline">HOWEVER</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">all of those things that Thi500 did back then seem practically insignificant compared to the absolutely vile things that “Aaron” has done in much more recent times.</span>
<br>

<br>
<br>To anyone who is capable of thinking rationally, <span style="font-weight:bold">this shouldn't be that difficult to understand.</span> Which is worse: <span style="font-weight:bold">to have a blog of yours be unfairly rejected, or to be falsely accused of being a pedophile? <span style="text-decoration:underline">This isn't rocket science</span>.</span>

<br>
<br>Similarly, <span style="font-weight:bold">“Aaron's” <span style="text-decoration:underline">repeated</span> efforts to get DCTheGamr permabanned from Paint are also far worse than anything Thi500 did back then.</span> Yet he <span style="text-decoration:underline">repeatedly</span> insists that I'm holding onto some old grudge from 2019 for him rejecting a few of my blogs. <span style="font-weight:bold">No, this is <span style="text-decoration:underline">entirely</span> about all that he's done <span style="text-decoration:underline">from 2022 onwards</span>.</span>

<br>It is incredibly ironic that whenever I criticize some evil thing that Thi500 does in the present, <span style="font-weight:bold">he tries to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflection_(psychology)" rel="nofollow">deflect</a> and make it about the past,</span> just as I had mentioned earlier. In the 1st screenshot above, we can see him doing this by trying to make my complaints about this very blog of his and also my complaints about his repeated attempts to get DCTheGamr permabanned about me “[getting] back at [him]” instead. In the 2nd one, we see him claim that I have “allowed [my] hatred of [him] to twist [my] mind, until [I] became the very thing I swore to destroy” (what did I “swear to destroy” again?), which I immediately correct him on by pointing out the obvious: <span style="font-weight:bold">that posting this disgusting blog of his is <span style="text-decoration:underline">by far</span> the worst thing that he's ever done to me,</span> and that I bore him no ill will prior to that. In the 3rd one, he references his previous <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/d8f7631c-45f7-430a-99f6-3ed16dfe3d1f.jpg" rel="nofollow">non-apology</a>, prompting me to bring up how he had previously referred to my <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">83 day long</span> (April 4th 2024 to June 25th 2024)</span> demotion as a “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/3154bcea-6ef3-42b9-ab4e-7787f1f73a59.jpg" rel="nofollow">slap on the wrist</a>”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>, causing him to try to <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gaslighting" rel="nofollow">gaslight</a> me into believing that my demotion was only for 3 days, and telling me to “get real”<span style="font-weight:bold"></span>. The 4th screenshot is one of him over half a year later, defending the very same admin abuse that he keeps insisting is the basis for all of my issues with him in the first place. <span style="font-weight:bold">Yet he still insists that Thi500 is “long gone”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span> and that he's this “Aaron” person now.</span>
<br>(What freaking difference does that make to me? <span style="font-weight:bold">They're both bullies, abusive admins, and manipulative <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Bullshit" rel="nofollow">BS</a> artists</span>.)

<br><blockquote>[Projection is] the process by which one attributes one’s own individual positive or negative characteristics, affects, and impulses to another person or group.

<br>If we are to play along with this ridiculous little charade of his, it was not Thi500 who had falsely claimed that there were “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/366f5988-9a11-4aac-88ae-72805c51fdac.jpg" rel="nofollow">legitimate pedophilia allegations with screenshot evidence</a>” against me, <span style="font-weight:bold">“Aaron” did.</span> Thi500 did not get me demoted from my position as a blogmin and pollmin for <span style="text-decoration:underline">THREE MONTHS</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">“Aaron” did.</span> It wasn't Thi500 who “[didn't] care what [my] home situation is”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, who called me “the scum of the fucking Earth”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, “mentally fucking braindead”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, “a fucking man-child” who doesn't have “friends my own age”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, “mentally challenged”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, “not all there”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, say that it was “hard to say” whether or not I am a pedophile, and that I “should not be around children much less help run a website that’s mostly populated by children”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>, and that “this isn’t the first time we’ve had [a pedophile], but with any luck, it will be the last”<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>. <span style="font-weight:bold">“Aaron” was the one who did all of those evil things to me, and then told me I “got off easy” and that it all “NEEDED to happen” to me.</span> <img src="https://3dspaint.com/chatroom/smilies/alien2.gif">
